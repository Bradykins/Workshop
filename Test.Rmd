## plain text

This is my sample document that has some plain text

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=TRUE}
foo <- 1:10
class(foo)
```

Now to make a pretty plot
```{r}
plot(cars$dist)
```
